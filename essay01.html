<h1 class="western">Planetary Cartography and Traveller World Maps</h1>
<p>How Traveller World Maps align with Planetary Cartographic
practices formalized by the International Astronomical Union (IAU).<br/>
A
Historian's perspective.</p>
<p>If you are at all familiar with maps of the Earth, you might be
under the impression that the other planets in the Solar System and
beyond are indexed in just that way.<br/>
This is not the case. The
truth is convoluted, plagued with obsolete conventions, and a source
of contention.</p>
<h2>...Because Sumeria...</h2>
<p>The current system of measuring time and angles in the western
world is a direct descendant of the base-sixty mathematics developed
5000 years ago in Mesopotamia. Their sexagesimal numbers persist into
the Twenty-first Century as degrees (360) arc-minutes (60 per degree)
and arc-seconds (60 per arc-minute). As well as our digital clocks
(23:59:59). Latitude and Longitude are measured in degrees no matter
what planet you are on. Be very grateful no one seriously considered
Radians.</p>
<h2>...Because Boats...</h2>
<p>Finding your way at sea without reliable landmarks is possible
because ancient peoples realized the regularity of the positions of
Sun Moon and stars. Hipparchus suggested lines of Latitude and
Longitude about 2000 years ago. He chose Rhodes as being at the Prime
Meridian. Directions were determined by the wind. Seasonal winds were
predictable while transient breezes could be identified by weather
conditions. The “Wind Rose” was an essential navigation tool.</p>
<h2>...Because Imperialism...</h2>
<p>Making world maps really became important. (That bit's mine! That
bit's not mine, but I want it!) It is at this point that some
conventions got cemented into the field. <br/>
A) North is at the
top. Before this, East was at the top in Christendom and South was up
in Cathay. <br/>
B) The cardinal points were reduced to the four we
are familiar with. (The Compass Rose is valid on all planets
everywhere)<br/>
C) East and West are measured in degrees from the
Prime Meridian at zero.</p>
<h2>...Because Galileo's Moon...</h2>
<p>Galileo's telescope and the sketches he made of the Moon in 1609
turned it from a convenient nightlight in the sky to a place. Now it
had to be mapped. So of course the same Earthly system was applied.
The &quot;Selenographic Coordinate System&quot; persists to this day.
North is up, The Prime Meridian runs through the center, East on the
right, and West on the left. The Moon and the Earth are the only two
Solar System bodies divided this way. On the Moon or the Earth, you
must specify Longitude E or W from 0 to 180.</p>
<h2>...Because Telescopes...</h2>
<p>Fortunately for the first extra-planetary map makers, the Moon
never turns away from us. And it is close enough and large enough for
even poor telescopes to give amazing details... with one annoying
flaw. Telescopes turn everything upside down. So, many images printed
in textbooks, periodicals, and educational diagrams, are labeled
South at the top. You have probably seen pictures of Jupiter with the
great Red Spot in the &quot;Northern&quot; Hemisphere. Lies. All
lies. Hidden in the caption is the phrase &quot;South to Top&quot;. 
</p>
<h2>...Because Cameras...</h2>
<p>Planets rotate while you are observing them. Take a telescopic
photo of Mars, wait a few hours and repeat. yup, it rotated. The
Martian landscape slides westward by about 15 degrees of Longitude
every hour. This is great. It allows you to photograph and map most
of the planet over a period of a few hours. Since the view never goes
backward it only makes sense to abandon the two hemisphere idea and
map Mars using &quot;Positive West Longitude&quot;. Ignore the East
and number every meridian from +0 to +360 West from left to right
(The map is upside down so West is on the right). The accepted
standard &quot;Positive West Longitude&quot; is also referred to as
Planetographic. (from photographic)</p>
<h2>...Because tipping...</h2>
<p>And while we're at it, let's rigidly define North on other planets
as whichever pole is closest to the North Ecliptic Pole (near the
Cat's Eye Nebula). Actually, it's phrased differently by the IAU. The
exact wording is &quot;The North Pole of a planet is that pole of
rotation that lies on the North side of the Invariable Plane of the
Solar System.&quot; What could possibly go wrong? Hold my beer.</p>
<h2>...Because Venus...</h2>
<p>Cloudy cloudy Venus didn't share the fact that she rotates
backwards till it was too late. So, instead of Venus having a North
pole tipped way over, her top pole is North-ish. Which isn't a
problem until you realise the Sun now rises in the West. Oh joy. East
and West don't get switched to fix this because the Compass Rose was
settled as a constant. No matter what planet you are on, the Compass
Rose is valid. The Sunrise must have got it wrong. (the word East
literally means sunrise!) Venus maps are generally Positive East,
South up, right to left. If you get it wrong, take a shot and pass
the bottle anti-clockwise.</p>
<h2>...Because Machines...</h2>
<p>Robots and computers visited Mars and mapped more than any human
being mapped any other place ever in the history of history. Do you
remember how convenient it was to use a telescope to make a Mars map
with Positive West Longitude and South at the top? Not any more.
Satellites orbit Prograde, from West to East, so the Longitudes sweep
past the other way. Positive West gets things backward, and nobody
needs to flip the maps upside down for telescopes any more. The new
hotness for Mars is &quot;Positive East Longitude&quot;! <br/>
This
decision irked many scientists, engineers, and astronomers. Just
subtract it from 360 to convert. What could possibly go wrong? Try
not to crash your spacecraft with basic arithmetic. I'm looking at
you 'Mars Climate Orbiter'. &quot;Positive East Longitude&quot; is
also referred to as Planetocentric. 
</p>
<h2>...Because all the moons...</h2>
<p>The majority of moons in the Solar System are tidally locked to
their parent body. Some exoplanets probably exhibit this behavior.
The natural way to fix this is with the &quot;Thermocentric
Coordinate System&quot;. The meridian facing the parent is the Prime
Meridian. Just like the Earth's Moon. The edge that faces forward as
it orbits the parent is +90W. Unless you're using Planetocentric
coordinates in which it is +270E. Got that? Great. Throw it all out
because Triton orbits Neptune retrograde. Use your trusty Compass
Rose. Pass the bottle anti-clockwise standing on your head.</p>
<h2>...Because it's less blurry now...</h2>
<p>As the photos get better, the coordinates get refined. The Prime
Meridian of Mars was first set in the mid Nineteenth century as the
center of the fork in Sinus Meridiani; A blurry smudge on a tiny
glass plate. Later this was pinpointed as the center of Airy Crater,
then further refined as the center of a smaller crater within;
Airy-Zero. The Longitude of Mars is now fixed by the position of the
Viking-1 lander being +47.95137° West. (+W Planetographic) Don’t
forget to convert to Positive East Coordinates! (+42.04863°East )
AAHH!!</p>
<h2>...Because Gas Giants...</h2>
<p>Yeah, clouds. We can see the Latitudes but what about Longitudes?
Clouds are busy, don’t bother them with questions. The answer is
snarly magnetic fields. The Jovian System III Coordinates track the
magnetic field and are Positive West. This superceded systems I and
II. Read about it somewhere else though.</p>
<h2>...Because the Sun...</h2>
<p>The Sun has a surface. Should we map it? Sure, why not. The Sun is
mapped using the Carrington Coordinate System developed in the 1850s.
I’m sure it can be generalised for any star. A bit too involved for
this essay. If you decide to land on the Sun's surface, be sure to do
so at night. For safety.</p>
<h2>...Because FINALLY !...</h2>
<p>In the last few decades so many small bodies have been discovered
and cataloged in such fine detail, the IAU decided to use a non
Earth-Centrist system for these numerous mappable mini-worlds.
Asteroids, minor planets, Kuiper Belt objects, comets, and moonlets
all use The simplified &quot;Right Hand Rule&quot; (RHR). In this
system we throw out North altogether. Use your right hand and curl
your fingers in the direction of rotation. Now your thumb is pointing
to the &quot;Positive Pole&quot;. The stars always rise in the East,
North is up, and you can still use your perfectly valid compass rose.
Longitudes are 0 to +360 East left to right, North is +90, South is
-90. Although there are obscure orbit/rotation rates that make it
possible for sunrise to take place in the West, the odds are
vanishingly remote as tidal forces would overwhelm any such
configuration.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I think it is likely that when we do finally start mapping
exoplanets, the +E RHR will be adopted as common sense. <br/>
Star-rise
in the East, North at top, Longitude 360 degrees from left to right,
Prime Meridian wherever you want it.<br/>
This is consistant,
logical, intuitive, and hard to misunderstand. Go make some maps.</p>

<h1 class="western">The Traveller World Maps</h1>
<p>So, now we come to the Traveller World Maps and their distinctive
Icohex format. If we assume the IAU extends the RHR, then the North
(Positive Pole) is at the top. Longitudes increase +East 0-360 from
left to right. The Prime Meridian is chosen by whichever governing
body administers that world and would be marked by some obvious
topological feature or a beacon. Tidally locked worlds might have the
prime meridian set to thermocentric standard but are just as likely
to choose some more stable and convenient point such as the capitol
city or primary transport station.</p>
<h2>Icohex ?</h2>
<p>I had to invent the term &quot;Icohex&quot; as things must have
names. I searched. I can find no name for the format anywhere in the
game literature. The name I chose is a contraction of &quot;Hexagon
Reticulated Icosahedral Dissection&quot; (&quot;Hexico&quot; sounds
too much like a petrochemical corporation that tried to kill Batman)</p>
<h2>A description of its parts:</h2>
<p>The format is assumed to be a disassembled Icosahedron, and that
makes perfect sense. 20 equilateral triangles in that arrangement
will obviously fold up into a Platonic Icosahedron. In cartography,
this is referred to as a dissection. Although the lack of
nomenclature has lead to calling them “Icosahedral projections”,
this is misleading. A map projection requires precise and intricate
mathematical functions to convert from non-euclidean geospatial
coordinates to an XY Cartesian plane. All map projections introduce
distortions and dissections while preserving some other aspects of
topology; area, distances, proportions, etc. What ought to be
preserved in this case?</p>
<p>The hexagon grid is used to generalize location and distance, but
has no associated mathematical definition. Although it is stated that
the hexagons have a fixed diameter, this is not mathematically
possible on the surface of a sphere. This makes the hexagons part of
a “reticulation”; a separate overlay used for reference. When
grids are mathematically defined, it is a &quot;graticulation&quot;. 
</p>
<h2>Map projection choices and assumptions:</h2>
<p>The Traveller maps do not show Latitudes or Longitudes; this makes
reverse engineering the matrix functions impossible. There are
several ways to project a sphere onto a polyhedron, two reasonable
options for our purposes are; Gnomonic, and Cylindrical. 
</p>
<p>Cylindrical projections preserve Latitudes and Longitudes as
straight lines.<br/>
HEALPix is an example</p>
<p>Gnomonic projections preserve Great Circles as straight
lines.<br/>
Dymaxion is an example</p>
<p>Both approaches are equally valid. The visual differences are
subtle. Neither has any aesthetic disadvantage.<br/>
Free software
converters exist for both.</p>
